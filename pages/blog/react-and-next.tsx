    <p className="mb-4">React and Next.js are powerful tools for building modern and interactive web applications. In this article, we'll explore the basics of these technologies and how they work together.</p>

    <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">What is React?</h3>
    <p className="mb-4">React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows you to create reusable UI components and efficiently manage the state of your application. React uses a virtual DOM (Document Object Model) to update only the necessary parts of the UI, resulting in better performance.</p>

    <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">What is Next.js?</h3>
    <p className="mb-4">Next.js is a framework built on top of React that adds server-side rendering, static site generation, and other advanced features to your React applications. It simplifies the process of building and deploying React-based websites by providing built-in routing, server-side rendering capabilities, and optimized performance.</p>

    <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Benefits of Using React and Next.js</h3>
    <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
      <li>React's component-based architecture allows for reusability and easier maintenance of code.</li>
      <li>Next.js provides server-side rendering, which improves initial load times and SEO performance.</li>
